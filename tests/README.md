# Testing Documentation

These tests are not really intended for use yet. They are very rudimentary and not properly thought out. 

The library can still change a lot, so introducing comprehensive tests does not make sense yet. 


## Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
poetry run pytest

# Run specific test file
poetry run pytest tests/test_hub_api.py

# Run with coverage report
poetry run pytest --cov
```
